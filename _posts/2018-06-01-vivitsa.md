This project is named after Sanskrit word **Vivitsa** meaning *desire of knowledge*.

Back in 2016 my roommate introduced me to the book called [Little OS Book](https://littleosbook.github.io/), at that I 
was busy doing my other projects. Also, neither I was confident about my expertise on the subject nor I was interested 
in doing that project. After two years in 2018, after thoroughly reading couple of books on operating systems I wanted 
to do something big to keep my spirits high!

I must say I was so excited while doing this, apart from OS I was able to learn a lot about writing MakeFile, 
[QEMU x86 Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU) and tricks to run it inside docker. Not only this I added hooks
to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) which triggers build on my commits and publishes test results. 

Please visit [Project Website](https://ragu-manjegowda.github.io/vivitsa) to know more about this.
