# ragu-manjegowda.github.io

Ragu's personal web site, using the design of http://html5up.net/spectral 
by [@ajlkn](http://twitter.com/ajlkn) and Jekyll theme by 
[@arkadianriver](https://arkadianriver.github.io/arkadianriver.com/).

## Build/Preview

You don't necessarily have to build it locally to see the changes. 
GitHub has CI hook that triggers everytime you push a change. 
You can simply check commits to see the build status.

To preview as you build locally,  
From the repo's root directory
```
RUBYOPT='-W0' bundle exec jekyll serve --future --drafts
```

Open a browser to http://localhost:4000 (or the port number that jekyll 
indicates to open)

## Credits

* I would like to thank my beloved wife [@Sinduja Raghavendra](https://github.com/sindujak29) 
for teaching me web development and helping me fixing bugs 
in the original theme to make the website [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design).

* Obviously I should thank [@Gary Faircloth](https://github.com/arkadianriver) 
for this wonderful theme.
