     I have carved my own path, creating a lifestyle that blows my mind with itâ€™s utter simplicity,
     fun and pure potentiality. I am deeply influenced by certain people and characters in novels,
     viz., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poornachandra_Tejaswi" target="_blank">Poornachandra Tejasvi</a>'s "Parisarada Kathe",
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muddana" target="_blank">Muddanna</a>'s "Muddanna Manorameya sarasa sallapa",
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama" target="_blank">Sri Rama</a>Sri Rama and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shravan" target="_blank">Shravana Kumara</a>'s character in Ramayana, and many more!
     <br> </br>
     The most important thing in my life is religious believes, moral values and respect for elders.
     I am modern thinker but also believe in good values given by our ancestors. I love watching 
     movies and reading novels also interested in knowing history and literature related to 
     Karnataka and Hinduism. I often write poems and sometimes short stories. I love non-veg
     (Chicken and Fish). I know cooking almost all south indian dishes (thanks to youtube!).
