     I'm a software engineer passionate about building elegant solutions and creating meaningful technology. 
     My journey combines modern innovation with timeless principles, drawing inspiration from literature, 
     philosophy, and the rich cultural heritage of Karnataka.
     <br> </br>
     I believe in the power of simple, well-crafted systems — whether it's code, workflows, or life itself. 
     My work spans from <strong>keyboard-driven development</strong> environments to full-stack applications, 
     always with an eye for efficiency and user experience.
     <br> </br>
     When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, writing about development practices, 
     or diving into classic literature. I'm particularly drawn to stories that explore human potential 
     and the intersection of tradition with progress.
